# Assignment

## Build a weather app

For this assignment please use the **tech stack** requested in the email that was sent to you.
If no tech stack was defined, we would suggest to use [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) coupled with [**Redux**](https://redux.js.org/).

### **PART I**

Using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) we want you to create a page where the current weather will be displayed as well as the forecast for the next 7 days. For the current weather, we want you to get the user's location and get the weather from that location (in case you canâ€™t fetch the location of the user, then use these coords for Leiria [39.74362, -8.80705]). The same is valid for the forecast data.

The current weather and the forecast data must display an icon corresponding to the type of weather (this is valid for part I and part II).

To solve this problem, there is no need for user authentication.

### API KEY

If you do not have an OpenWeatherMap API key, create one for free. All the services you need are free of charge.
To get the API key, go to https://openweathermap.org/price and then you'll be able to get a key for `Current weather and forecasts collection` under the free section.

Relevant pages to check the API are:

-   https://openweathermap.org/current
-   https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api

### **PART II**

On this part we want you to add a bit more complexity to the application.
After this part is concluded, the user should be able to:

-   Add a city (with country) in order to check the weather in different places
-   Remove a city from that list
-   Get current weather from any added city
-   Get 7 day weather forecast for any added city
-   Persist the cities that are added by the user (along with the country)
-   Give feedback to the user in every relevant operation he does
